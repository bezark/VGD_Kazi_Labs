Lab 1
Description: A main scene with multiple instances of other scenes. I made the main scene the main character of the game, which is a fish. The other scenes are secondary characters and also the background. endl;
My vision: I am recreating a game that I used to play when I was a child: You start off as the small fish and you have to eat fish that are even smaller in order to grow to the largest fish. You have to avoid getting eaten by the larger fish that come and go. endl;
Questions: endl;
How do I code the characters to move? endl;
What is the point of having multiple scenes/ What is a scene? endl;
